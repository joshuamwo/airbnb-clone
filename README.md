I got this idea for my mentor. He said cloning when favourite website could be a way to display your skin.

Yes I'm going to do it.  The first website I'm going to rebuild is one of my favorites the airbnb website. I like the design of it and I also have a passion for the housing market.

This will be a documentation of the journey. 

THE ACTUAL DESIGN.

I'm going to try to recreate the design isn't figma because it's my favourite tool for designing things for the web. Of the whole recreation getting the colours right of actually the toughest part of the design. I made use of some Chrome extensions one of them being  "what the font" to get the fonts that were used in the actual airbnb website. I sourced the icons from font-awesome. They have a really great collection and I am planning to use their icons in my coming next projects. 

ON TO THE EASY STUFF.

I said easy because as a developer, design is usually the hardest part of it. From the actual code, I'm going to be using a framework of JavaScript - React JS ever since I came across react it has been my go-to for my web projects.

A lot of people say if you use frameworks you're not a real developer and do you know what I say to them? 
MAMBO NI MINGI, MASAA NI CHACHE. Get with the times bro. 

My favourite quote of all time is: 
"Out of extreme complexities emerges extreme simplicities."




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
